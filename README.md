# Markdown to HTML
- This repository takes all markdown files and converts them to html

- For multi line code blocks that start with \`\`\` do not indent the entire block. You can indent the code in the block. Engage will ignore any indentation of the block.
- Make sure a blank line follows the end of any \`\`\` code block or the following line may become part of the code block.
- Any code block, even single \` code blocks, will be on there own line in engage. For example, `This text will be on its own line` and this text will be on the line below.
