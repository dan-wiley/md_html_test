- Docker is fun
- Docker works
  - Same on every machine
  - Has packages installed on images already!

1. Use this image to run the code below
  ```
  FROM python:3.10.0
  # this is all you need for basic python
  ```

```python
print("hello worldzzzz")
text="new text"
text += " again"
if text:
    print(text)
    # prints new text again
```

- hello world
> This is not a nested block quote
