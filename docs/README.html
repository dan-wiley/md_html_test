<ul>
<li>This repository takes all markdown files and converts them to
html</li>
<li>For multi line code blocks that start with ``` do not indent the
entire block. You can indent the code in the block. Engage will ignore
any indentation of the block.</li>
<li>Do not indent blockquotes &gt; , it will not render in
engage</li>
<li>Make sure a blank line follows the end of any ``` code block or
the following line may become part of the code block.</li>

line in engage. For example,
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>This text will be on its own line</code></pre></figure> and this text will be on
the line below.</li>
