<p>One simple approach to making a database backup to create another
Persistent Volume Claim and using a cronjob to backup the database.</p>
<p>In Kubernetes, a Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) is a request for
storage by a Pod. It allows Pods to request specific resources on a
Persistent Volume (PV), which abstracts the underlying storage
implementation details. This setup is crucial for applications that
require persistent storage, such as databases.</p>
<h2 id="persistent-volume-pv">Persistent Volume (PV)</h2>
<p>A Persistent Volume (PV) in Kubernetes is a piece of networked
storage provisioned by an administrator or dynamically provisioned using
Storage Classes. PVs abstract the underlying storage details (like AWS
EBS volumes) and provide a uniform interface for Pods to consume
storage.</p>
<h2 id="storage-class-sc---aws-gp3">Storage Class (SC) - AWS GP3</h2>
<p>A Storage Class defines the types of PVs that can be dynamically
provisioned and their properties. In our case, we use AWS Elastic Block
Storage (EBS) GP3 volumes, a type of storage optimized for transactional
and throughput-intensive workloads. GP3 volumes are commonly used in AWS
EC2 instances and provide flexibility in adjusting performance and cost
based on application requirements.</p>
<p>Notice in the prod env that the deployment-deb-prod.yaml file
contains an import for a persistent volume claim, which is then mounted
to the container. Below is a sample of the code template.</p>
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>        volumeMounts: # The volume mounted to the container
        - name: orderbookdb-&lt;TEAM&gt; # Must match name of volume below
          mountPath: /var/lib/mysql # Location of MYSQL Database
      restartPolicy: Always
      volumes:
      - name: orderbookdb-&lt;TEAM&gt; # Create and name a volume from a PVC
        persistentVolumeClaim: # import the PVC
          claimName: ebs-gp3-claim-&lt;TEAM&gt; # Must be the same name as the PersistentVolumeClaim</code></pre></figure>
<p>The code above simply imports an existing Persistent Volume Claim
(PVC), and mounts it. The code below creates the PVC in
pv-claim-prod.yaml.</p>
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: ebs-gp3-claim-&lt;TEAM&gt;
  namespace: &lt;COHORT&gt;-&lt;TEAM&gt;-prod # Team's namespace
spec:
  storageClassName: gp3 # Must be the same as the PersistentVolume. Look for kind: StorageClass yaml file
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 1Gi</code></pre></figure>
<h2 id="how-to-implement-a-backup">How to implement a backup</h2>
<p>Simply create another Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) file (different
file name, and metadata.name). Then, create this cronjob to back up the
database with the mysqldump command. Do not forget to update the
namespace.</p>
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: mysql-backup-cronjob
  namespace: &lt;COHORT&gt;-&lt;TEAM&gt;-&lt;ENV&gt;

              claimName: ebs-gp3-claim-second-team06 # Use the second persistent volume claim
          containers:
          - name: mysql-backup
            image: public.ecr.aws/docker/library/mysql:8.0.31  # Use the mysql:8.0.31 image
            env:
            - name: MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD
              value: "wiley123"  # Replace with your MySQL root password
            command: ["/bin/bash", "-c"]
            args:
            - |
              #!/bin/bash

              # MySQL connection details
              MYSQL_USER=root
              MYSQL_HOST=orderbookdb
              MYSQL_PORT=3306

              # Backup directory
              BACKUP_DIR=/var/lib/mysql/backup
              BACKUP_FILE="$BACKUP_DIR/backup-$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S).sql"

              # Dump MySQL databases to a file
              mysqldump -u $MYSQL_USER -p$MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD -h $MYSQL_HOST -P $MYSQL_PORT --all-databases &gt; $BACKUP_FILE

              # Cleanup old backups
              MAX_BACKUPS=5
              cd "$BACKUP_DIR" || exit 1
              num_backups=$(ls -1 | wc -l)
              if ((num_backups &gt; MAX_BACKUPS)); then
                  # Sort backup files by modification time and delete the oldest ones
                  ls -1t | tail -n +$((MAX_BACKUPS + 1)) | xargs rm -f
              fi
            volumeMounts:
            - name: backup-dir
              mountPath: /var/lib/mysql/backup  # Mount the backup directory from the second volume
          restartPolicy: OnFailure</code></pre></figure>
<p>Having the database backed up on two EBS volumes is a good idea, now
if something happens to one, we have a backup. Better yet, if the
Kubernetes administrator creates another storage class, we can update
the storage class in the new PVC to back it up with a different storage
class (such as a different cloud provider like Azure).</p>
<p>Run the command below to verify the backup is made correctly.</p>
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>kubectl describe cronjob mysql-backup-cronjob -n &lt;COHORT&gt;-&lt;TEAM&gt;-&lt;ENV&gt;
kubectl get pvc -n &lt;COHORT&gt;-&lt;TEAM&gt;-&lt;ENV&gt;</code></pre></figure>
<h2 id="restore-from-backup">Restore from backup</h2>
<p>If you ever need to restore from a backup, you can simply connect a
pod to the PVC and restore from it. Another way to achieve this goal is
to take snapshots of the PVC. However, additional tools must be
installed in our cluster for snapshots.</p>
<p>If you want to take this implementation to a hot-warm setup, create
another deployment and mount the new PVC to it. If the first one fails,
you can use the new one. The new deployment can also be used for read
operations.</p>
