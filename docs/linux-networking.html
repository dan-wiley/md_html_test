<div class="lesson-content"><h1 id="linux-networking-and-sys-admin">Linux Networking and Sys
Admin</h1>
In this activity, we will be covering some basic commands for
performing system administration in Linux. It is important to be able to
identify what processes are using the most resources, what ports they
are running on, how much memory your machine has left, network commands,
and more.
<h2 id="memory">Memory</h2>
Not having enough can cause applications to fail or perform poorly.
Simply run the command below to see a summary of your machine’s
memory.
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>cat /proc/meminfo</code></pre></figure>
From the output, pay special attention to the values below.<br/>
- <strong>MemTotal</strong> gives you the total RAM installed.<br/>
- <strong>MemFree</strong> shows the currently unused RAM.<br/>
- <strong>MemAvailable</strong> estimates the RAM available for new
applications, considering caches and buffers that can be freed.
Alternatively, you can use this command below
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code> free --mega -h # --mega for megabytes, -h for human readable.
 # man free # for options</code></pre></figure>
If you want to watch it live, you can use the
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>watch "free --bytes"</code></pre></figure> command or simply use
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>vmstat 1</code></pre></figure>. A better approach may be to use <figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>ps</code></pre></figure>
and sort by memory. this was we can see what processes are using the
most memory.
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>ps aux --sort -rss # rss is Resident Set Size (memory descending)
ps aux --sort -%mem # % of rss used by the process. The minus sign before %mem indicates descending order, whereas a plus sign would do ascending.
ps -eo user,pid,%mem,stat,cmd --sort=-%mem # only include output (-o) columns that we want (user,pid,%mem,stat,cmd)
ps aux --sort -%cpu # can also sort by cpu
ps aux --forest # useful to see a tree of parent processes
watch 'ps aux --sort -%mem | head' # run the command every 2 seconds
top # use top</code></pre></figure>
<h2 id="inodes">Inodes</h2>
A Linux filesystem uses blocks to store file data. Each block is a
fixed-size unit of storage, commonly 4 KB (4096 bytes).
An inode is a data structure that stores metadata about a file, such
as its size, ownership, permissions, and timestamps, along with pointers
to the blocks where the file’s actual data is stored. Each file or
directory is represented by an inode, which has a unique inode
number.
<h3 id="example">Example</h3>
To illustrate, consider a file that is 8 KB in size. You can use the
command below to create one:
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>dd if=/dev/urandom of=8kb_file bs=1K count=8</code></pre></figure>
The file would need two 4 KB blocks to store its data.<br/>
The inode for this file would contain metadata about the file and
pointers to the two blocks where the data is stored.<br/>
Use the stat command below to examine the file.
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>stat 8kb_file</code></pre></figure>
<ul>
<li>You may notice it says 16 blocks. This is because the stat command
considers each block to be 512 bytes. Notice that each 4096 io block
contains 8 512-byte blocks, and the file size is 8192 bytes (2
blocks).</li>
</ul>
<strong>You can also run out of inodes, to check how many you have
use this command:</strong>
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>df -i</code></pre></figure>
<h2 id="network">Network</h2>
<h3 id="network-diagnostic-tools">Network Diagnostic Tools</h3>
<h4 id="ping">Ping</h4>
The ping command uses the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) to
test the connectivity between your machine and another host. It sends
ICMP echo requests and waits for replies. This command is especially
useful for testing if two machines can communicate with each other.
ping <hostname_or_ip> For example, to ping Google’s DNS server:</hostname_or_ip>
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>ping 8.8.8.8</code></pre></figure>
This will continue to send packets until you stop it (usually with
Ctrl+C). You can specify the number of packets to send using the -c
option:
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>ping -c 4 8.8.8.8</code></pre></figure>
<h4 id="nslookup">nslookup</h4>
The nslookup command is used to query DNS to obtain domain name or IP
address mapping.
nslookup <hostname_or_ip> For example, to find the IP address of
example.com:</hostname_or_ip>
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>nslookup example.com</code></pre></figure>
You can also perform a reverse lookup to find the domain name
associated with an IP address:
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>nslookup 8.8.8.8</code></pre></figure>
<h4 id="traceroute">traceroute</h4>
The traceroute command shows the path that packets take to reach a
network host. It can help diagnose routing issues.
traceroute <hostname_or_ip> For example, to trace the route to
example.com:</hostname_or_ip>
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>traceroute example.com</code></pre></figure>
<h4 id="dig">dig</h4>
The dig (Domain Information Groper) command is used to query DNS name
servers. It provides detailed information about DNS records.
dig <hostname> For example, to get DNS information for
example.com:</hostname>
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>dig example.com
# You can also query specific DNS record types, such as A, MX, TXT, etc.:
dig example.com A
dig example.com MX
dig -x 8.8.8.8 # reverse DNS lookup</code></pre></figure>
<h4 id="curl">curl</h4>
The curl command is used to transfer data to or from a server,
supporting various protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, etc. Here are some
use cases: Some of the examples below may not work because we are using
an example domain. Nonetheless, run them to see the output.
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>curl https://example.com</code></pre></figure>
Save Output to a File: Save the retrieved web page to a file:
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>curl -o index.html https://example.com</code></pre></figure>
Follow Redirects: Follow HTTP redirects and show the final URL:
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>curl -L -o redirected.html https://example.com</code></pre></figure>
Send POST Data: Send POST data to a server:
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>curl -X POST -d 'username=user&amp;password=pass' https://example.com/login -f # -f is to fail on http error, useful for scripts or pipelines that use exit codes</code></pre></figure>
Headers and Cookies: Include headers or cookies in requests:
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>curl -H "Authorization: Bearer token" https://api.example.com/data
curl -b "cookie1=value1; cookie2=value2" https://example.com</code></pre></figure>
<h3 id="listening-ports">Listening Ports</h3>
It is important to know if your machine is listening for incoming
connections. Remember, everything in Linux is a file. Therefore, we can
use the list open files (lsof) command to see what ports are open and to
what hosts.
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>sudo lsof -i -P # sudo is likely needed</code></pre></figure>
You should see ssh open to <figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>*:22</code></pre></figure>, indicating that any
host connecting on port 22 can connect to your machine. You may also
notice the PID attached to this port. You can use that PID in the ps
command as <figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>ps -p &lt;pid&gt;</code></pre></figure>
<h3 id="monitoring-network-traffic">Monitoring network traffic</h3>
Run the command below and then try to spam SSH into your machine
without the key. If you have a webserver running, spam your webserver
while using this command. You will be able to monitor the network
activity connecting to your machine.
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>netstat -c # c is for continuous
ss # this is similar, you can see how many established connections are on your machine and what protocol they are using (eg how many people are logged in via ssh or using your web server)</code></pre></figure>
<h3 id="private-ip-and-subnet">Private IP and Subnet</h3>
A network interface is an active connection to a network where you
have been assigned an IP address. You may have more than one network
interface; typically, you will have at least one for your private
network and one for your localhost network (loopback interface).
To see information on each of your network interfaces, you can run
the following command on Unix-like operating systems:
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>ifconfig</code></pre></figure>
<ul>
<li><strong>inet</strong>: This is the IP address assigned to the
network interface. This can be a private IP address (in the case of
IPv4) or a global address (in the case of IPv6).</li>
<li><strong>netmask</strong>: This indicates which portion of the IP
address represents the network and which part represents the host. It is
typically shown in the form of a subnet mask. For example:</li>
</ul>
<ol type="1">
<li>A netmask of 255.0.0.0 (or /8 in CIDR notation) indicates that the
first 8 bits of the IP address are the network part. If an IP address is
172.0.5.1 with a netmask of 255.0.0.0, then all IPs in that network must
start with 172.x.x.x.<br/>
</li>
<li>A netmask of 255.255.255.0 (or /24 in CIDR notation) indicates that
the first 24 bits of the IP address are the network part. If an IP
address is 172.39.44.1 with a netmask of 255.255.255.0, then all IPs in
that network must start with 172.39.44.x.<br/>
</li>
<li>With a netmask of 255.255.255.0, the network can have 256 addresses,
ranging from 172.39.44.0 to 172.39.44.255. The first address
(172.39.44.0) is the network address, and the last address
(172.39.44.255) is the broadcast address, leaving 254 usable IP
addresses for hosts.</li>
</ol>
If you need more machines in your network, you can use a larger
subnet (a smaller netmask), which allows more IP addresses. This is
typically done using CIDR notation.
<ul>
<li><strong>Broadcast</strong>: This is the broadcast address for the
network. It is used to send data to all devices on the network. For
example, with a network address of 172.39.44.0/24, the broadcast address
would be 172.39.44.255</li>
</ul>
