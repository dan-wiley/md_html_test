<div class="lesson-content"><h1 id="yaml-error-alerts">YAML Error Alerts</h1>
Our environment runs our containers in Kubernetes. We add YAML files
to the sre-course-infra GitHub repo and FluxCD (our continuous
deployment tool) automatically deploys the YAML files. FluxCD uses
Kustomization objects (./apps/resources/student-kustomizations) to track
what YAML files it should continuously deploy. Notice in your
Kustomization file flux is instructed to deploy each YAML file inside
your team folder (./apps/eks-sre-course/<your-team-folder>).</your-team-folder>
What if there is an error in a YAML file in your team folder? FluxCD
will not deploy the changes. How will you know about an error? To find
YAML errors you can use kubectl to search the logs of a
kustomization.
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code> kubectl get kustomizations -A | grep &lt;cohort-team-env&gt;</code></pre></figure>
However, this requires you to authenticate in the CLI. We can take
advantage of Grafana logs using the <strong>Loki</strong> data source
and run the query below to access the logs from the command above.
Replace cohort and team with your actual cohort and team.
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>{job="flux-system/kustomize-controller"} |= `cohort` |= `team` |= `error`</code></pre></figure>

Both solutions above will show YAML errors, but you will have to
check the logs. Having an automated alert send a message when there is
YAML error will save you time from searching logs. Follow the steps
below to create a Microsoft Team that will receive an alert each time a
YAML error is created.
<ol type="1">
<li>Create the Microsoft Team and add your team members to it.</li>
<li>Create a webhook and save the URL to the webhook. <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/webhooks-and-connectors/how-to/add-incoming-webhook?tabs=newteams%2Cdotnet">Make
a Webhook</a></li>
<li>In Grafana create a new Folder. Use your cohort and team number to
name it, such as c500team01. <a href="https://grafana.computerlab.online/dashboards/folder/new">Make a
Folder</a></li>
<li>Then create a dashboard in that folder using the same naming
convention, such as c500team01-alerts. Remember to use your actual
cohort and team.</li>
<li>Create a panel, edit it, select Loki, name it YAML Errors, and use
the query below. It is similar to the one above, except it will be a
line chart displaying the number of YAML errors per minute.</li>
</ol>
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>sum(
count_over_time({job="flux-system/kustomize-controller"} |= `cohort` |= `team` |= `error`[1m])
or vector(0)
)</code></pre></figure>
<ol start="6" type="1">
<li>Save the dashboard. In the YAML Errors panel, click on the alerts
tab. Make sure the alert fires when the threshold is above 0. Add a
group to the alert, such as your cohort-team-yaml errors. All other
settings should remain the same. Save the alert.</li>
<li>Navigate to the <a href="https://grafana.computerlab.online/alerting/notifications">contact
points page</a> under alerts in Grafana. Add a new contact point. Use
your cohort and team number to name the contact point. Select Microsoft
Teams and add your webhook URL. Test and save the contact point.</li>
<li>Navigate to <a href="https://grafana.computerlab.online/alerting/routes">notification
policies</a> then click new policy, and click add matcher. The label
should be <strong>grafana_folder</strong> and the value is the name of
your grafana folder from above. Select your contact point and save the
policy.</li>
</ol>
If you follow those steps correctly, a Microsoft team alert will be
sent if there is a YAML error. <strong>Try introducing a YAML
error</strong> and adding another panel to your dashboard to see the
specific error messages.
You can add a panel with this command to your dashboard to read the
logs, just select the logs visualization type and update your cohort and
team like before.
