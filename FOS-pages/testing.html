<div class="lesson-content"><h1 id="add-testing-to-prod-promotion">Add Testing to Prod
Promotion</h1>
In this activity, we will create a pipeline to test some endpoints.
This activity aims to automate the testing of multiple endpoints at a
time and gain time metrics. This test can be useful for mandating a
successful dev env before promoting the code to prod.
It would be best practice to make this test a separate pipeline and
then call this pipeline from a new stage in the promote pipeline.
Remember that in pipelines, the exit code of a command determines if
a stage or step fails. After practicing some CLI commands, this
assessment will require applying exit codes to a pipeline.
<h2 id="test-in-cli">Test in CLI</h2>
Try running the command below in Git Bash, macOS Terminal, or
Linux.
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code># returns the web page, -f will fail if http error
curl https://c369team01dev-api.computerlab.online/docs -f

# view the exit code. Anything other than 0 is a fail
echo $? </code></pre></figure>
How can we utilize the exit code to make sure the documentation web
page is available? In the pipeline, simply run
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>curl https://c369team01dev-api.computerlab.online/docs</code></pre></figure> and
if the exit code is not zero it will fail.
What if you want to continue the pipeline on a failed exit code? You
can always force a successful exit code.
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code># adding || true will catch any failed codes (||) and return a success one (true). 
# You can always force fail with false or with exit 1. 
curl https://c369team01dev-api.computerlab.online/docs -f || true</code></pre></figure>
<h2 id="jenkins-testing">Jenkins Testing</h2>
Your goal is to complete a pipeline that performs the following
test:
<ol type="1">
<li>Is the documentation page available?</li>
<li>Is the Login page available?</li>
<li>Is the Stock Quote endpoint available? Can you check the output to
see if it returns the correct data?</li>
<li>Use parameters instead of hard coding endpoints.</li>
<li>One other test you create on your own.</li>
</ol>
Use the starter code below. You can use any combination of stages or
steps you find appropriate.
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code>pipeline {
    agent {
        node {
            label 'generic-agent'
        }
    }
    stages {
          stage('Test Availability of API Docs') {
            steps {
                script {
                    sh """
                    curl "https://${COHORT}${TEAM}dev-api.computerlab.online/docs" -f
                    """
                }
            }
        }
    }
}</code></pre></figure>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next Steps</h2>
We should never promote to prod without testing dev. After
implementing some testing, modify the prod promotion pipeline to include
your tests. If possible, keep your test as a separate pipeline and
invoke the test pipeline from within your promote pipeline. This way,
you can continue to modify and add testing to your test pipeline without
modifying the promote pipeline.
<h2 id="unit-testing">Unit Testing</h2>
Referring back to the course content, testing is done across a
spectrum. This means that each stage of the SDLC, and their
corresponding teams, is responsible for different testing. The testing
above falls under Integration and Functionality testing. This is the
responsibility of the operations or QA team.
Unit testing involves testing each unit of executable code and is the
responsibility of the code authors, aka developers. You may have
developed some code in the currency API, so each function should include
a unit test. If the unit test fails, the Jenkins pipeline that builds
the images and delivers them to ECR should fail, preventing the build.
This can be achieved by running a test in the Dockerfile.
Consider the multi-stage Dockerfile code below. The first image is
used solely for testing. If the tests all pass, then the second FROM
statement uses that image to build the app. For simplicity, you can use
a single-stage docker file, but it is common to use a two-stage one for
unit testing. The goal is to just run a code file containing the tests,
and stop the build if it fails.
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code># Stage 1: Build and test
FROM python:3.9 AS test

WORKDIR /app

# Install test dependencies
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the source code
COPY . .

# Run unit tests
RUN python -m unittest discover -s tests

# Stage 2: Production image
FROM python:3.9-slim AS prod

WORKDIR /app

# Copy only the necessary files from the test stage
COPY --from=test /app .

# Set up the application
# Example:
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

# Copy the application code
# COPY . .

# Set the command to run the application
# CMD ["python", "app.py"]
</code></pre></figure>
Example of an app
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code># app.py
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b</code></pre></figure>
Example of a test
<figure><pre class="prettyprint nocode"><code># test_app.py

import unittest
from app import add_numbers

class TestAddNumbers(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add_numbers(self):
        self.assertEqual(add_numbers(1, 2), 3)
        self.assertEqual(add_numbers(-1, 1), 0)
        self.assertEqual(add_numbers(0, 0), 0)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()</code></pre></figure>
